server and client for my first-ever game!

json key added to the server, I lost accsess to that firebase account.
And I'm not responsible for anything related to it. (I do not need it so I have no issue publishing it, it is very basic,
no actual validation, it just contains the user's name, password and friend list)

(I may make a local db option like sql lite for it to run locally in the future)

you can change the "mykey.json" file to your own firebase account key. you will get the same effect.

you will need some firebase database to run. (create firebase account and change 'mykey.json' to your key)

server requirements:
1. firebase-admin
2. numpy

client requirements:
1.pygame
