server and client for my first-ever game!

this usess pygmame for the client
and numpy + firebase-admin for the server

json key added to the server, I lost accsess to that firebase account.
And I'm not responsible for anything related to it.

you can just change the "mykey.json" file to your own firebase account key. you will get the same effect.

you will need some firebase database to run. (create firebase account and change 'mykey.json' to your key)

server requirements:
1. firebase-admin
2. numpy

client requirements:
1.pygame
