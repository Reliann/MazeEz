# MazeEz
server and client for the first-ever multiplayer game I made back at 2018.

- The server uses sqlite3 local DB (Old version used firebase DB)
- players are required to "sign up" and can invite a friend to join the party.
- server builds game room with a unique maze for each party (kill and hunt algorithem).
- Server and client made with socket and select (no other libraries).

  
Players can queue up and play!
