server and client for my first-ever game!

this usess pygmame + numpy for the client
and numpy + firebase-admin for the server

json key added to the server, I lost accsess to that firebase account.
And I'm not responsible for anything that happens if you use it.

you will need some firebase database to run. (create firebase account and change 'mykey.json' to your key)
